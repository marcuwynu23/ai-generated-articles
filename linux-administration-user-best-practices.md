# Linux Administration: Why You Should Avoid Root for Deployments and Use Deployer Instead

## 🚀 Why You Should Avoid Using Root for Deployments

In many server deployments, it’s tempting to SSH as `root` because you avoid permission issues. But directly using root poses serious **security and operational risks**:

- **Root has full power:** If your SSH key or password leaks, an attacker can do anything.
- **No accountability:** With multiple people or CI/CD systems using the same root account, it’s impossible to track actions.
- **Easy to break the system:** Small mistakes (like a mistyped command) can break everything instantly.
- **Bypasses best practices:** Security principles recommend the **least privilege** possible for each task.

### 🛡️ Why Use a Dedicated Deployer User Instead?

Using a **dedicated `deployer` user** minimizes these risks:

✅ **Limited scope**:  
Deployer only has the minimal permissions needed for deployments. If compromised, it can’t destroy your entire system.

✅ **Use `sudo` for root-level actions**:  
`deployer` can still restart services or copy to protected directories using `sudo`, but only when needed.

✅ **Logs and auditing**:  
`sudo` logs every privileged command, so you know who did what.

✅ **Easier to revoke**:  
If someone leaves the team, you only remove their deployer access—not full root access.

## 🛠️ Setting Up a Deployer User with Root Privileges

Let’s assume you’re logged in as **root**:

1️⃣ **Create the deployer user**:

```bash
adduser deployer
```

2️⃣ **Add deployer to the `sudo` group**:

```bash
usermod -aG sudo deployer
```

3️⃣ **Allow passwordless sudo** for seamless deployments (edit with \`visudo\`):

```bash
visudo
```
Add this line:
```
deployer ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```
✅ Now \`deployer\` can run **any** \`sudo\` command **without a password**.

---

## 🔐 Configure SSH Access

1️⃣ **On your local machine**, generate an SSH key if needed:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deployer key"
```

2️⃣ **Copy your public key to the server**:

```bash
ssh-copy-id deployer@your.server.ip
```

or manually add it to:

```bash
/home/deployer/.ssh/authorized_keys
```


---

## ⚙️ Using `deployer` Like Root

Now, instead of SSHing as root:

```bash
ssh root@server
```

You connect as deployer:

```bash
ssh deployer@server
```

For privileged commands (like installing packages or restarting services):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

✅ No password needed because of the \`NOPASSWD\` config.

---

## 🔥 Example: Transition from Root-based to Deployer-based Deployment

Here’s a **sample CI/CD script** for root:

```bash
ssh root@server <<'EOF'
  cd /var/www/myapp
  git pull origin main
  npm ci
  npm run build
  systemctl reload nginx
EOF
```

---

### ✅ Updated script for deployer:

```bash
ssh deployer@server <<'EOF'
  cd ~/myapp
  git pull origin main
  npm ci
  npm run build
  sudo cp -r build/* /var/www/myapp/
  sudo systemctl reload nginx
EOF
```


---

### 💡 Key Points in the Updated Flow:

✅ **SSH as deployer, not root**.  
✅ **Use \`sudo\` only for tasks that truly require it** (like copying to \`/var/www\` or reloading nginx).  
✅ **All logs show deployer as the actor**, improving auditability.

---

## ✍️ Final Thoughts

🔒 **Security**: Using \`deployer\` limits potential damage if credentials leak.  
🔧 **Best practice**: Principle of Least Privilege—use the smallest set of permissions needed.  
📈 **Scalable**: Works smoothly with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.

### 🔗 Sample SSH Deployment Flow in GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Deploy to production
  uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0
  with:
    host: ${{ secrets.VPS_IP }}
    username: deployer
    key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOYER_SSH_KEY }}
    script: |
      cd ~/myapp
      git pull origin main
      npm ci
      npm run build
      sudo cp -r build/* /var/www/myapp/
      sudo systemctl reload nginx
```


---

### ✅ Summary of Commands to Transition from Root to Deployer:

1️⃣ Create deployer:  
```bash
adduser deployer
usermod -aG sudo deployer
```


2️⃣ Allow passwordless sudo (\`visudo\`):

```
deployer ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```


3️⃣ Copy your SSH key to deployer.

4️⃣ SSH as deployer, use \`sudo\` for privileged tasks only.

---

✅ Done! You’re now following best practices for secure deployments.
