# **Trello Guide on Agile Methodology**  

Agile methodology is a popular approach to software development that emphasizes **iterative progress, collaboration, and flexibility**. One of the most effective tools for managing Agile workflows is **Trello**—a simple, visual project management tool that allows teams to track their tasks in real-time.  

This guide will walk you through how to use Trello for Agile, including **Sprint planning, task assignments, scheduling, team roles, workflow setup, and collaboration best practices**.

## **🔹 Understanding Agile and Scrum in Trello**  

Agile development follows an **iterative process**, breaking work into small, manageable cycles called **Sprints** (usually 1-2 weeks long). The team works collaboratively, regularly reviewing progress and adjusting priorities.  

**Scrum** is one of the most common Agile frameworks, where teams follow a structured approach involving:  
✅ **Product Backlog** (List of all features & tasks)  
✅ **Sprint Backlog** (Tasks selected for the current Sprint)  
✅ **Daily Stand-ups** (Short team meetings to track progress)  
✅ **Sprint Reviews** (Evaluating completed work & improvements)  

Trello makes it easy to implement these concepts through **boards, lists, and cards**.

## **🔹 Setting Up Your Trello Board for Agile**  

### **1️⃣ Create a Trello Board**  
Start by creating a **new board** in Trello and naming it based on your project. Example: **"Inventory App Development"**.  

### **2️⃣ Add Lists (Columns) for Workflow**  

Each **list represents a stage in your Agile workflow**:  

1. **Product Backlog** – All upcoming tasks & features (managed by the Product Owner).  
2. **Sprint Backlog** – Tasks selected for the current Sprint.  
3. **In Progress** – Tasks actively being worked on.  
4. **Code Review** – Lead Developer reviews and approves code.  
5. **Security Testing** – Security Expert validates security aspects.  
6. **Testing / QA** – Testers verify functionality and report issues.  
7. **Done** – Completed and approved tasks.

## **🔹 How Task Scheduling Works in Agile Trello**  

### **Who Assigns and Schedules Tasks?**  
- **Product Owner** selects and prioritizes tasks in the **Product Backlog**.  
- **Scrum Master** assigns tasks from the **Sprint Backlog** based on availability and expertise.  
- **IT Manager** ensures that tasks align with deadlines and business goals.  
- **Lead Developer** assigns complex coding tasks and oversees development.  
- **Security Expert** schedules security checks for completed features.  

### **Example of Task Scheduling in Trello:**  
- **Monday:** Product Owner moves "Develop Login System" to **Sprint Backlog**.  
- **Tuesday:** Scrum Master assigns it to Developer A → Moved to **In Progress**.  
- **Wednesday:** Developer A completes it → Moves to **Code Review**.  
- **Thursday:** Lead Developer approves code → Moves to **Security Testing**.  
- **Friday:** Security Expert checks for vulnerabilities → Moves to **Testing / QA**.  
- **Saturday:** Testers approve the task → Moves to **Done**.

## **🔹 Best Practices for Using Trello in Agile**  

### **✅ Use Labels for Task Prioritization**  
- 🔴 **High Priority** – Critical issues or key features.  
- 🟡 **Medium Priority** – Important but not urgent.  
- 🟢 **Low Priority** – Minor updates or enhancements.  

### **✅ Use Checklists for Subtasks**  
- Break complex tasks into **smaller steps**. Example:  
  - [ ] Design login UI  
  - [ ] Develop API endpoint  
  - [ ] Write unit tests  

### **✅ Use Comments for Communication**  
- Developers, testers, and security experts **discuss issues directly on the task card**.  
- Example: *"Bug found on mobile view, needs UI fix before release."*  

### **✅ Automate with Trello Power-Ups**  
- **Butler Automation** – Auto-assign tasks based on labels.  
- **Calendar View** – Track Sprint deadlines visually.  
- **Slack Integration** – Get real-time Trello updates in Slack.

## **🔹 Example Agile Workflow in Trello**  

Let's say your team is building a **dashboard feature for an Inventory App**.  

1. **Product Owner** adds a card: *"Develop Inventory Dashboard UI"* → Moves it to **Product Backlog**.  
2. During **Sprint Planning**, **Scrum Master** assigns it to Developer A and moves it to **Sprint Backlog**.  
3. **Developer A** picks it up → Moves to **In Progress**.  
4. After coding, **Developer A** moves it to **Code Review**, where the **Lead Developer** checks the code.  
5. **Security Expert** performs a security review → Moves to **Security Testing**.  
6. If no security issues, **Testers** validate the feature → Moves to **Testing / QA**.  
7. Once tests pass, the task moves to **Done**, and the team discusses improvements in the next **Sprint Review**.
