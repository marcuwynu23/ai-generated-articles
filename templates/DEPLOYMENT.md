# Deployment Procedure

## Overview

This document outlines the steps required to deploy the application to production. It covers pre-deployment checks, the build and deployment process, rollback procedures, and post-deployment verification.

## Environment Setup

- **Production Environment:**
  - Server details, IP addresses, and domain configuration.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Database, cache services, third-party APIs.
- **Environment Variables:**  
  Ensure the following environment variables are set in production:
  - `NODE_ENV=production`
  - `DATABASE_URL=your-database-url`
  - `API_KEY=your-api-key`
  - (Additional variables as required)

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Code review and merge completed.
- [ ] Automated tests passed.
- [ ] Manual QA and user acceptance testing completed.
- [ ] Database and data backups taken.
- [ ] Environment variables and secrets updated.

## Deployment Workflow

### Step 1: Build

- **Local Build:**  
   Run the following command to generate the production build:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  Verification:
  Confirm that the build output is generated correctly (e.g., in a /dist folder).
  Step 2: Staging Deployment (Optional)
  Deploy the build to a staging environment to perform final tests.
  Verify functionality, performance, and stability in staging.
  Step 3: Production Deployment
  Using Direct Server Deployment
  Stop Current Services:
  Gracefully stop any running instances of the application.
  Deploy Build:
  Copy the new build output to the production server.
  Start Application:
  Launch the production build:
  bash
  Copy
  npm start
  Using Docker
  Pull Latest Images:
  bash
  Copy
  docker-compose pull
  Recreate Containers:
  bash
  Copy
  docker-compose down
  docker-compose up -d
  Rollback Plan
  Git Rollback:
  If issues arise, revert to the previous commit:
  bash
  Copy
  git revert <commit-id>
  Re-deploy:
  Redeploy the last known stable build.
  Backup Restore:
  Restore the database or any necessary data from backups if required.
  Post-Deployment
  Verification:
  Check application logs for errors.
  Confirm that all services are running as expected.
  Run smoke tests to ensure core functionality.
  Monitoring:
  Monitor system performance and error reporting tools.
  User Feedback:
  Gather early user feedback for any issues not caught during testing.
  Troubleshooting
  Document common issues and their resolutions.
  Include contact information for the on-call team or deployment lead.
  Additional Notes
  Customize any steps as per your infrastructure or tooling.
  If using CI/CD pipelines, integrate these steps into your automation scripts.
