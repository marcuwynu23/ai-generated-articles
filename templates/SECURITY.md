# Security Policy

We take security seriously. This document outlines our security procedures and expectations for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

For security issues, only maintained versions are supported. Please ensure you are using a supported version before reporting a vulnerability.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not disclose it publicly. Instead, follow these steps:
  
1. **Email Us:** Send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with the subject "Security Vulnerability Report".
2. **Details to Include:**  
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Impact assessment, if known.
   - Any relevant logs or screenshots.
  
We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and work with you to resolve the issue as soon as possible.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a fix is available, we will provide public disclosure. In cases of critical vulnerabilities, we may request a delay in disclosure to coordinate a fix. We appreciate your patience and responsible disclosure.

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the contributions of the security community in helping us improve our project. Thank you for helping to make our project more secure.
