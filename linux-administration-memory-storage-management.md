# **A System Administrator’s Guide to Evaluating Memory and Storage Health**

As a **system administrator**, ensuring the health of your system’s **memory (RAM), swap, and storage (SSD/HDD)** is critical for maintaining optimal performance. Mismanagement of these resources can lead to **slow performance, system crashes, and data loss**.

In this guide, we will walk through **how to read, understand, and evaluate system memory and storage**, ensuring your system runs smoothly.

## **Understanding System Memory (RAM) Usage**

### **Checking Total, Used, and Available RAM**

The first step in evaluating memory is understanding how much RAM is available, used, and cached.

Run the following command to check RAM usage:

```sh
free -h
```

**Key Metrics Explained:**

- **Total:** The total installed RAM.
- **Used:** The memory actively used by applications.
- **Available:** Free memory + cached memory that can be used when needed.
- **Swap:** Virtual memory used when RAM is full.

### **How to Interpret the Output?**

✅ **Healthy:** "Available" memory is sufficient, and swap usage is low.  
⚠️ **Warning:** Low "Available" memory and moderate swap usage.  
❌ **Critical:** High RAM usage with swap being actively used (system slowdown).

### **Analyzing Memory Consumption by Processes**

To see which processes are consuming the most memory:

```sh
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
```

If a single process is consuming an **unusually high percentage of memory**, consider optimizing or restarting it.

### **Detecting Memory Leaks**

Memory leaks occur when an application **does not release memory properly**, causing increasing RAM usage over time.

Check for potential memory leaks using:

```sh
smem -rt  # Show RAM usage sorted by total
```

If a process keeps growing in memory usage without decreasing, it may have a **memory leak** and should be investigated.

## **Evaluating Swap Usage**

### **Checking Swap Usage**

```sh
swapon --summary
```

If swap usage is consistently high, it means **the system is running out of RAM**.

Another way to check swap activity is:

```sh
vmstat 1 5
```

- **si (swap-in)** and **so (swap-out)** should be close to zero under normal conditions.
- High swap activity suggests **the system is struggling with insufficient RAM**.

### **When to Take Action?**

✅ **Healthy:** Swap is barely used.  
⚠️ **Warning:** Swap usage is around **30-50%**, indicating a need for RAM optimization.  
❌ **Critical:** Swap is heavily used, making the system slow. Consider **adding more RAM**.

## **Assessing Storage Health and Performance**

### **Checking Disk Space Usage**

```sh
df -hT
```

This command shows:

- **Used %:** If above **90%**, the system may experience slowdowns.
- **Filesystem Type:** ext4, xfs, etc. (Check compatibility with your OS).

Find large directories consuming disk space with:

```sh
du -sh /* | sort -hr | head -10
```

### **Analyzing Disk I/O Performance**

High disk activity can slow down the system. Monitor disk I/O with:

```sh
iostat -xz 1 5
```

- **%util:** If close to **100%**, the disk is overloaded.
- **await:** If high, it indicates **slow disk response times**.

Another useful command:

```sh
iotop -o
```

It shows processes causing **high disk usage**, helping identify problematic applications.

### **Checking for Disk Errors and Bad Sectors**

#### **SMART Diagnostics (SSD/HDD Health Monitoring)**

```sh
smartctl -a /dev/sda
```

**Important SMART Attributes:**

- **Reallocated_Sector_Ct:** If **>10**, the disk may fail soon.
- **Current_Pending_Sector:** Non-zero value means **bad sectors** are present.
- **Power_On_Hours:** If **>50,000 hours**, consider replacing the disk.

#### **Scanning for Bad Sectors**

```sh
badblocks -sv /dev/sda
```

If errors are found, the disk may be **failing** and should be replaced.

#### **Checking File System Integrity**

To repair filesystem errors:

```sh
fsck -f /dev/sda1
```

Run this command only when the disk is **unmounted**.

## **Measuring Overall System Performance**

### **Checking System Load**

```sh
uptime
```

The output shows system load averages for **1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes**.

✅ **Healthy:** Load is below the **number of CPU cores**.  
⚠️ **Warning:** Load is equal to CPU core count.  
❌ **Critical:** Load is **2x or more than CPU cores**, causing slowdowns.

To find the most CPU-intensive processes:

```sh
top -o %CPU
```

## **When to Take Action?**

| **Metric**                  | **Healthy**        | **Warning**             | **Critical**            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **RAM Usage**               | Free RAM available | Swap usage increasing   | Swap 100%, system slow  |
| **Swap Usage**              | Low or zero        | >30% usage              | >90% usage              |
| **Disk Usage**              | <70% used          | 80-90% used             | >90% full               |
| **Disk Read/Write Latency** | <5ms               | 5-20ms                  | >20ms                   |
| **SMART Errors**            | No errors          | Reallocated sectors <10 | Reallocated sectors >10 |
| **CPU Load**                | <1 per core        | ~1 per core             | >2 per core             |

## **Conclusion: Keeping Your System Healthy**

- **Monitor RAM & Swap:** Keep an eye on available memory and avoid excessive swap usage.
- **Check Disk Health:** Run SMART diagnostics and look for high I/O latency.
- **Analyze Performance Regularly:** Use `iostat`, `vmstat`, and `iotop` to prevent system slowdowns.
- **Optimize Resources:** Remove unnecessary files, upgrade RAM if needed, and monitor high-memory-consuming processes.

By following these steps, **system administrators** can ensure their systems remain fast, stable, and efficient.
