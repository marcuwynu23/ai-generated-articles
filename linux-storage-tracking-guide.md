# ðŸ›  How to Track Down Excessive Storage Consumption on a Ubuntu linux

Running out of disk space on your VPS can break critical services like **nginx**, **databases**, or **PM2 apps**. Knowing how to track and fix excessive storage usage is essential for smooth server management.

This guide will walk you through practical steps to identify whatâ€™s eating your storage and how to clean it safely.

---

## 1. Check Overall Disk Usage

First, see which partitions are filling up:

```bash
df -h
```

Example output:

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        80G   75G  2.5G  97% /
```

ðŸ‘‰ Usually `/` is the one you need to investigate.

---

## 2. Identify Large Directories

Check which top-level directories are consuming space:

```bash
sudo du -sh /* 2>/dev/null | sort -h
```

Common suspects include:

- `/var` â†’ logs, databases, caches
- `/home` â†’ user files, uploads
- `/usr` â†’ packages and libraries

---

## 3. Drill Down Into Culprits

If `/var` is large, investigate further:

```bash
sudo du -sh /var/* 2>/dev/null | sort -h
```

Keep drilling down (e.g., `/var/log`, `/var/lib`, `/var/www`) until you find the big offenders.

---

## 4. Find Oversized Files

Locate huge files directly:

```bash
sudo find / -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -k5 -h
```

Look for:

- Giant log files (`.log`, `.json`)
- Old backups (`.sql`, `.tar.gz`)
- Cached packages or builds

---

## 5. Inspect Logs

Logs often grow uncontrollably.

Check log sizes:

```bash
sudo du -sh /var/log/* | sort -h
```

Systemd journal logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl --disk-usage
```

Example issues:

- `/var/log/suricata/eve.json` â†’ IDS logs bloating to tens of GB
- `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/auth.log` â†’ unrotated system logs

---

## 6. Check Package Caches

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo du -sh /var/cache/apt
sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get autoremove -y
```

On CentOS/RHEL:

```bash
sudo du -sh /var/cache/yum
sudo yum clean all
```

---

## 7. Check Docker (if used)

Docker images, volumes, and containers can consume huge space:

```bash
docker system df
docker system prune -af --volumes
```

---

## 8. Use Interactive Tools

Install **ncdu** for an interactive view:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ncdu -y   # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install ncdu -y       # CentOS/RHEL

sudo ncdu /
```

Navigate with arrow keys to find whatâ€™s using the most space.

---

## 9. Prevent Future Problems

- **Enable log rotation** (`logrotate` or `pm2-logrotate`)
- **Configure app logging** (reduce verbose logs like Suricataâ€™s `eve.json`)
- **Move backups** off the VPS (e.g., S3, external storage)
- **Monitor disk usage** with tools like `monit`, `netdata`, or simple cron jobs emailing `df -h`

---

## âœ… Summary

When your VPS runs out of space:

1. Use `df -h` to see full partitions
2. Use `du -sh` to find large directories
3. Drill down into logs, caches, and user files
4. Identify large files with `find`
5. Clean safely â€” truncate logs, clear caches, rotate backups
6. Prevent it from happening again with log rotation and monitoring
