# 🧩 Ways to Create a Seamless Application for Multiple Standalone Microfrontends

As modern web applications scale, many teams are turning to **microfrontend architecture** to split large apps into smaller, manageable, and independently deployable units. However, serving standalone apps (like with NGINX) is only half the battle—making them work **seamlessly together** as one cohesive user experience requires thoughtful integration.

This guide explores the **top strategies** to stitch together multiple microfrontends into a single, unified application.

## 🔧 1. Single-SPA: The Microfrontend Orchestrator

[Single-SPA](https://single-spa.js.org/) is a powerful JavaScript framework for orchestrating multiple frameworks or libraries as microfrontends.

### 🛠 How It Works:

- You build each app independently (e.g., `/app1`, `/app2`).
- A root-config app manages which one to load based on the route.
- Uses SystemJS or native `import()` to load apps dynamically.

### 📄 Example:

```js
registerApplication({
  name: "@org/app1",
  app: () => System.import("@org/app1"),
  activeWhen: ["/app1"],
});

registerApplication({
  name: "@org/app2",
  app: () => System.import("@org/app2"),
  activeWhen: ["/app2"],
});

start();
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Route-based activation
- Supports multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Rich ecosystem and documentation

## 🧪 2. Module Federation (Webpack 5)

[Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) allows apps to **share code** and **load each other at runtime**.

### 🛠 How It Works:

- Apps expose components via `ModuleFederationPlugin`.
- Other apps consume them as `remotes`.
- Great for sharing dependencies like React, styles, and state.

### 📄 Example:

#### App1 Webpack Config

```js
plugins: [
  new ModuleFederationPlugin({
    name: "app1",
    filename: "remoteEntry.js",
    exposes: {
      "./App": "./src/App",
    },
    shared: ["react", "react-dom"],
  }),
];
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Shared dependencies = faster load
- Dynamic import = performance benefits
- Works well with CI/CD and versioning

---

## 🧭 3. Custom Router + JavaScript Runtime Integration

You can manually load microfrontend apps using `<script>` tags and mount them into specific DOM nodes.

### 📄 Example:

```html
<div id="app1-root"></div>
<script src="/app1/main.js"></script>
<script>
  window.App1.mount(document.getElementById("app1-root"));
</script>
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Simple and flexible
- No build tool coupling

### ⚠️ Cons:

- You must define a global `mount()` function
- Managing shared state and dependencies gets tricky

---

## 📦 4. iframe-based Isolation (Optional for Admin Tools or Legacy Apps)

Embedding microfrontends inside `<iframe>`s is the most isolated approach.

```html
<iframe src="/app1" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Full isolation (CSS, JS, state)
- Safe for untrusted apps

### ⚠️ Cons:

- Navigation and deep linking are hard
- Poor performance and UX
- Not ideal for seamless integration

---

## 🌐 5. Import Maps and CDN-shared Libraries

You can serve shared dependencies (like React, Vue, etc.) via a CDN or `importmap`, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.

### 📄 HTML Example:

```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "react": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/react",
      "react-dom": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/react-dom"
    }
  }
</script>
```

### ✅ Pros:

- Smaller bundles
- Shared cache across apps

---

## 🛡️ NGINX Setup: Serving Standalone Microfrontends

If you’re serving apps like `/app1`, `/app2`, etc., a typical `nginx.conf` might look like:

```nginx
location = /app1 {
  return 301 https://$host/app1/;
}
location /app1/ {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /app1/index.html;
}
location /app1/assets/ {
  alias /var/www/apps/app1/assets/;
}
```

For seamless routing across apps, use a fallback rewrite rule:

```nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ @microfrontends;
}

location @microfrontends {
  rewrite ^/app1(/.*)?$ /app1/index.html break;
  rewrite ^/app2(/.*)?$ /app2/index.html break;
}
```

## 🧠 Best Practices for Seamless Integration

| Area              | Recommendation                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing**       | Centralize routing in a root-config app         |
| **State Sharing** | Use federated state management (Redux, Zustand) |
| **Styling**       | Namespace CSS or use Shadow DOM                 |
| **Auth**          | Shared authentication and session management    |
| **Navigation**    | Provide a global navigation shell or menu       |

## 📌 Conclusion

Serving multiple standalone microfrontends is just the first step. To **make them feel like one application**, you need:

- A shared orchestration layer
- Consistent routing and state
- Smooth user transitions

By using tools like **Single-SPA** or **Webpack Module Federation**, and proper server configurations, you can build a powerful, scalable microfrontend architecture that feels like a single product to your users.
