# üìò TypeDoc: Generating Documentation for TypeScript Projects

## üìù Introduction
When building modern applications with **TypeScript**, codebases quickly grow in size and complexity. Managing this complexity and ensuring that other developers (or even your future self) can understand the code is critical.  
This is where **TypeDoc** comes in.  

**TypeDoc** is a documentation generator specifically designed for **TypeScript** (and JavaScript with type definitions). Unlike traditional tools such as JSDoc or documentation.js, TypeDoc doesn‚Äôt just read comments ‚Äî it **parses the TypeScript Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**. This allows it to generate **complete, type-safe documentation** for your entire project automatically.

---

## üéØ Use Cases
TypeDoc is useful in many scenarios, including:

- **Open Source Projects** ‚Üí Provide API reference docs for libraries and packages.  
- **Enterprise Codebases** ‚Üí Maintain large, multi-team projects with shared knowledge.  
- **UI Component Libraries** ‚Üí Auto-document props, interfaces, and component APIs.  
- **SDKs & APIs** ‚Üí Generate developer documentation straight from the source code.  
- **Internal Tools** ‚Üí Keep documentation in sync with evolving code without manual effort.

## üöÄ Getting Started with TypeDoc

### 1. Install TypeDoc
```bash
npm install --save-dev typedoc
```

For Markdown output:
```bash
npm install --save-dev typedoc-plugin-markdown
```

---

### 2. Basic Configuration
Create a `typedoc.json` file at your project root:

```json
{
  "entryPoints": ["src"],
  "entryPointStrategy": "expand",
  "out": "docs",
  "plugin": ["typedoc-plugin-markdown"],
  "exclude": ["src/**/*.test.ts", "src/experimental/**"],
  "hideGenerator": true
}
```

---

### 3. Run TypeDoc
```bash
npx typedoc
```

This generates documentation inside a `docs/` folder.  
- By default, it creates **HTML docs** (interactive website).  
- With the Markdown plugin, it creates `.md` files suitable for GitHub, GitBook, Docusaurus, etc.  

---

### 4. Output Options

- **HTML (default)** ‚Üí Best for browsing via GitHub Pages, Netlify, or local viewing.  
- **Markdown (plugin)** ‚Üí Great for inline repo docs or knowledge bases.  
- **JSON** ‚Üí Export raw doc structure for custom pipelines or tools.  

---

## ‚ö° Example Workflow

1. Add an npm script:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "docs": "typedoc"
   }
   ```

2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run docs
   ```

3. Share the generated `/docs` with your team or host it online.  

---

## üìö Summary

- **TypeDoc is the best choice for TypeScript projects** because it leverages the TypeScript compiler to deeply understand your code.  
- It supports multiple output formats (HTML, Markdown, JSON).  
- With plugins (like `typedoc-plugin-markdown`), it integrates into static site generators (Docusaurus, Nextra, GitBook).  
- Ideal for **libraries, SDKs, and large projects** where keeping documentation in sync with code is critical.  

---

‚úÖ **In short:** TypeDoc turns your TypeScript code into **automated, living documentation**. It reduces manual effort, ensures accuracy, and helps teams and communities onboard faster.
